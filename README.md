# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Helps in keeping clients satisfied and ensuring that the software is relevant and no system has been corrupted .
We are able to plan earlier , notice risks and handle and many more

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Helps the customers to create a suitable non costy budget , while still meeting the needs required . Its also used to observe and anylise spending Regularly check actual costs vs. planned costs.
Enhancess the policy: Stick to the original plan and avoid unnecessary features.  We are all to use open-source tools: Instead of paid software, use free tools where possible.


## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is a flexible, iterative approach that allows for continuous feedback and adaptation, making it ideal for dynamic projects, while Waterfall follows a structured, sequential process that works best for well-defined projects with fixed requirements. Agile offers faster delivery and adaptability but may lack clear documentation, whereas Waterfall ensures thorough planning but can be rigid and slow to accommodate changes.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile works best for:
1.Projects with changing requirements .
Example: A mobile app startup that adjusts features available based on user feedback.
Waterfall works best for:
1.Well-defined projects with strict requirements.
2.Example: A hospital management system that needs detailed documentation and testing before deployment.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
1.Collecting feedback
2.Perfoming all the tests to ensure the developed system met the requirements of the customer

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

1.Helps in proper task allocation and scheduling
2.Helps track progress and identify bottlenecks.
3.Prevents delays by identifying dependencies between tasks.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
